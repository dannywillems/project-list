# My project list

Every day I have idea, like you and like everyone. I think some are great,
some are just useful for a task, some for everyone, some can turn into a company
to make lot of profits.

Instead of keeping my ideas in a file on my computer or on to-do list like I did
for a long time, I put them on Github.

I'm not afraid about someone who will take some ideas here and develop them
because I am sure I am not the first guy which has these ideas.

As I love free softwares, lot of them would be free. If you want to
develop some of them, tell me, make them free and I will add a link to them
here.
